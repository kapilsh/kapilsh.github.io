                    Hi, Iâ€™m Kapil Sharma. I am a Chicago-based Quantitative
                    Researcher and Data Scientist working in the High Frequency
                    Trading industry. Before that, I studied graduate-level
                    Mathematics and Quantitative Finance at Columbia University
                    in New York City. My professional interests include High
                    Frequency Trading, Quantitative Finance, Mathematics,
                    Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Programming.

                    When I am not coding and white-boarding equations, I love to
                    play music and watch football (aka soccer). I am a big
                    Chelsea F.C. fan. #KTBFFH I love to connect with like-minded
                    people. So, give me a shout!

                  Collection of articles and notes on interesting Math problems

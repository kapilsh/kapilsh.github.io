I am a Chicago-based Quantitative Researcher and Data Scientist working in the High Frequency Trading industry.

On this blog, I post

- Collection of articles and notes on interesting Math problems that I encounter on a daily basis
- Snippets and discussions related to new (for me) programming techniques, mostly in C++, Python, and Java
- My experiments with Machine Learning, Data Science, Algorithmic Trading, Trading System Design, Time-series Analysis, etc.

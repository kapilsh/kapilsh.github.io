Hi, Iâ€™m Kapil. I work as an Engineer at Meta. Currently, I work on the Pytorch team and primarily focus on making data preprocessing run at scale for personalization/ recommender systems. 

This blog mostly captures my hobby projects and things I experiment with outside of work as and when I get time. My current focus is GPU programming, LLMs, and inference performance. 

Previously, I have also worked as a Quant at Option Market Making and High Frequency Trading companies, where I worked on low-latency trading strategies and market-microstructure ML modelling.

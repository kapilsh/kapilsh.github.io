Hi, I'm Kapil Sharma. I am a Chicago-based Quantitative Researcher and Data Scientist working in the High Frequency Trading industry.
<br><br>
Before that, I studied graduate-level Mathematics and Quantitative Finance at Columbia University in New York City.
My professional interests include High Frequency Trading, Quantitative Finance, Mathematics, Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Programming.
<br><br>
When I am not coding and white-boarding equations, I love to play music and watch football (aka soccer).
I am a big <a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaFC">Chelsea F.C.</a> fan. #KTBFFH
<br><br>
I love to connect with like-minded people. So, give me a shout!
